# ve-admin

Investigation of VE estimates with surveillance and administrative data.

## Usage

All `.R` files are (should be) independent but expect the working directory to be that of the `.Rroj` file.

## Directories

* `fig-agesind` figures of one-at-a-time parameter variation in age groups individually.

* `fig-agesmult` figures of one-at-a-time parameter variation in populations composed of multiple age groups.

* `fig-fvinv` figure of investigation of the effect of vaccinated proportion and flu incidence in mixed populations.

* `fig-ortn` figure of the odds ratio in mixed population being affected by the vaccinated proportion in one of the subgroups.

* `fig-sfinv` figure of the odds ratio in a population being affected by flu incidence and flu test specificity.

* `fig-sfinv` figure of the odds ratio in a population being affected by true vaccine effectiveness.

* `pars` parameter values used and tables.

* `sim` simulations.

* `sim-diag` diagrams of how the core simualtion works.

* `sim-summary` summary of simulations.

* `tab-math` tables with math expressions.

* `tests` tests of functions. Expect functions to be in the global environment. RStudio's "Run Tests" will not work because it will not look there.

* `writeup` report of results.
